⚠️  Non-Storable Content — Risk: Informational (Medium)
📄 Description: The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.
💡 Solution: The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fieldsFor caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the responseFor caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:It must contain an "Expires" header fieldIt must contain a "max-age" response directiveFor "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directiveIt must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cachedIt must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).

🧾 Description: ## Overview [org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tomcat.embed/tomcat-embed-core) is a Core Tomcat implementation.  Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Resource Shutdown or Release due to the delayed cleaning of multipart upload temporary files. An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending crafted requests that create temporary copies of uploaded parts faster than the garbage collector clears them, leading to resource exhaustion.
 
 **Note:** Successful exploitation depends on the JVM settings, the application memory usage, and application load.  ## Details  Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.  Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.  One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.  When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.  Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:  * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).  * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Relative Path Traversal via the URL normalization. An attacker can bypass security constraints and access restricted directories such as `/WEB-INF/` and `/META-INF/` by manipulating the request URI. If PUT requests are also enabled then malicious files could be uploaded leading to remote code execution.

 1) Older, EOL versions may also be affected.

🧾 Description: ## Overview [org.springframework:spring-web](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework) is a package that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.  Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting via the `Content-Disposition` header where the `filename` parameter value could contain non-printable characters, causing parsing issues for HTTP clients. An attacker can cause the download of files containing malicious commands by injecting content into the response.  **Notes:**  1) This is only exploitable if the header is prepared with `org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition`, the filename is set via `ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, Charset)`, the value is derived from unsanitized user input, and the attacker can inject malicious content into the downloaded response.  2) The vulnerability was also fixed in the 6.0.29 commercial version. ## Remediation Upgrade `org.springframework:spring-web` to version 6.1.21, 6.2.8 or higher. ## References - [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/f0e7b42704e6b33958f242d91bd690d6ef7ada9c) - [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/35034) - [Spring Security Advisory](https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41234)

⚠️  Relative Path Traversal (Severity: High)
🧾 Description: ## Overview [org.springframework:spring-beans](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean) is a package that is the basis for Spring Framework's IoC container. The BeanFactory interface provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object.  Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Relative Path Traversal when deployed on non-compliant Servlet containers. An unauthenticated attacker could gain access to files and directories outside the intended web root.
 
 **Notes:**
 
 1) This is only exploitable if the application is deployed as a WAR or with an embedded Servlet container, the Servlet container does not reject suspicious sequences and the application serves static resources with Spring resource handling.
 
 2) Applications deployed on Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty are not vulnerable, as long as default security features are not disabled in the configuration.
 
 3) This vulnerability was also fixed in the commercial versions 6.1.22 and 5.3.44. ## Remediation Upgrade `org.springframework:spring-beans` to version 6.2.10 or higher. ## References - [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/3781ba223ed76823b99e9c699e0957b391e22bf9) - [GitHub Release](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v6.2.10) - [Spring Release](https://spring.io/blog/2025/08/14/spring-framework-6-2-10-release-fixes-cve-2025-41242) - [Vendor Advisory](https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41242)

⚠️  Incorrect Authorization (Severity: High)
🧾 Description: ## Overview [org.springframework:spring-core](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22spring-core%22) is a core package within the spring-framework that contains multiple classes and utilities.  Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Authorization via the `AnnotationsScanner` and `AnnotatedMethod` class. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by exploiting improper resolution of annotations on methods within type hierarchies that use parameterized supertypes with unbounded generics.
 
 **Note:**
 This is only exploitable if security annotations are used on methods in generic superclasses or generic interfaces and the `@EnableMethodSecurity` feature is enabled. ## Remediation Upgrade `org.springframework:spring-core` to version 6.2.11 or higher. ## References - [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/6d710d482a6785b069e35022e81758953afc21ff) - [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/35342) - [GitHub Release](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v6.2.11) - [Vendor Advisory](https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41249)

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Missing Authentication for Critical Function due to improperly locating method security annotations on private methods. An attacker could invoke the target method without proper authorization by exploiting this vulnerability.
 
 **Note:**
 
 This is only exploitable if your application is using `@EnableMethodSecurity(mode=ASPECTJ)` and `spring-security-aspects` and there are Spring Security method annotations on a private method. ## Remediation Upgrade `org.springframework.security:spring-security-core` to version 6.4.6 or higher. ## References - [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/commit/c972de5369a1261ab674a3f5e3a80e8ce3e8cdfb) - [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/17143) - [Spring Security Advisory](https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41232)
